  Mobilize Producer Betsy Nagler wraps up Season 2 with an interview with her
  father, Stephen Nagler, who was executive director of the New Jersey ACLU and
  then the Migrant Legal Action program in D.C.


  Stephen spent a large portion of his life fighting for those who were being
  denied the protections of the Bill of Rights-- establishing the types of
  precedents that the Trump administration now seeks to overturn.


  We explore the role activism played in Stephen's life, and discuss how how he
  feels about the activism of the current era.
