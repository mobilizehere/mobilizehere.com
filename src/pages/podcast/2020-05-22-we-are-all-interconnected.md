description: >-
  Globally, we have reached nearly 5 million cases of COVID-19.  The leader in
  that number is the United States, with over 1.5 million cases and almost
  100,000 deaths -- or more because of under-reporting. In this episode of
  Mobilize, producer Betsy Nagler interviews three medical care workers on the
  frontlines of the pandemic about what they and their communities are going
  through, and what they think it means for the country.
