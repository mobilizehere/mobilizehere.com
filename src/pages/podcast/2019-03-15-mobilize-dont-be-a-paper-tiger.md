### Transcript
**BN:** A lot of the battles that activists are fighting against the trump administration today are a continuation of the fight for civil rights and civil liberties for all Americans that has been taking place for decades. My father, Steven Nagler was a public interest lawyer in the nineteen sixties seventies and eighties who was involved in a lot of that work. As assistant general council for congress of racial equality then executive director of first the New Jersey State ACLU and then the migrant legal action program in Washington D.C. he spent the better part of three decades fighting for those who are being denied the protections of the Bill of Rights, establishing the types of precedents that the current administration seeks to overturn. Last year I sat down and talked to my dad about that work and the role it played in his life and how he feels about the activism of the current era.

**BN:** So tell me about what your upbringing was like -- where you grew up and how you sort of took an interest in activism.

**SN:** Well my parents were both socially conscious; I remember the daily worker being in our home when I was a kid.

**BN:** What's the Daily Worker?

**SN:** It was to the official newspaper of the US communist party but I don't think my father or my mother were communists. They were not active in any kind of particular political effort. My uncle was a leading labor Zionist, vice president of the International Ladies Garment Workers Union. I found out a few years later that in 1948 he and a colleague of his spent the year smuggling guns -- to Israel, of course. My uncle was active politically in 19-- I believe 1937 or 1938 my uncle was a candidate for Bronx borough president on the fusion ticket, which was headed by Fiorello LaGuardia who was running for mayor. They got together in reaction to much of the corruption that had been going on in the democratic city administration for many many years. But somewhat later when I was in college I had organized something called the city college public affairs forum. Among the speakers we invited were all of the presidential candidates but you know the fifties and college campuses generally and City College included was a time characterized by what has generally been described by the word apathy. So we would have these programs hold them in a big hall and have fifteen, twenty people in the room and to some extent it was a bit embarrassing. At one point we invited John Gates who at the time was the editor in chief for the Daily Worker. He was invited initially by students at Queens College to speak in Queens and the provost banned him from speaking at Queens College. Well we invited him to speak at City College after we saw that he'd been banned at Queens with a sort of "this can't happen here" attitude and lo and behold the president of City College banned him from speaking as well. We appealled to the board of higher education which affirmed the ban on the grounds that Gates was under indictment under the Smith Act: the act used to convict communists charging them with conspiracy to overthrow the government although none of these people actually were ever involved in any kind of an active effort to overthrow the government of the United States or any other government for that matter. A few months later I issued another invitation, this time to a man named Asa Carter who was the grand dragon of the Alabama Ku Klux Klan and again he was banned by the college president on the grounds that he was under indictment for murder in Alabama and that if he spoke at city college it might interfere with the ability to the State of Alabama to secure a fair trial. A position which we thought was completely ludicrous and the New York Civil Liberties Union declined to take on the case because we were absolutely right and the law was clear and they wouldn't make new law. From that standpoint we felt they were a bit of a paper tiger in that they were willing to tell you what your rights where but they would not take on a matter that protects civil liberties in situations in which civil liberties needed to be protected but in which they would not have the opportunity to make new law. That left an indelible impression on me for many years and decided me in essence to become actively involved in civil rights activities.

**BN:** Tell me about the Peace Corps and how you ended up in the Peace Corps and so on.

**SN:** I'd always been active from college on. In 1960 we ran the Kennedy campaign in Queens County and when Kennedy was elected I found the announcement of the Peace Corps very exciting. My wife and I were among the first volunteers to go in the Peace Corps generally and were the first group to go to what was then Nyasaland, which became Malawi while we were there. When we went into the Peace Corps in 1962 it was largely as a means of being active in the whole ethos of the Kennedy Administration and of the Kennedy campaign go to and learn a little bit about Africa and very much become involved with people in the playing an active role outside of teaching with our students that would foster economic development.

**SN:** We wound up volunteering for the Malawi Development Authority doing tree planting projects along local roads in order to prevent the roads from washing out during heavy rainstorms during the rainy season. I also wrote a chapter in a handbook for magistrates and teaching magistrates we had to figure out which line of law governed the newly independent nation of Malawi. At one point it would have been the high court of South Africa that was dictating the law. At another point it would have been the British Privy Council. At another point it would have been the high court of the federation of Rhodesia in Nyasaland. At another point it would have been the high court of Nyasaland so it was a rather interesting project to decide what the law was and help the country produce a body of laws which governed the country going forward.

**BN:** Congress of Racial Equality. How'd you end up in that job and what was that?

**SN:** You know I had two job offers when I came back from the Peace Corps. One was to be an assistent district attorney in New York County and the other was to work for Corps and I chose the Corps job on impulse in essence. I became active assistent general council. It was an overall civil rights organization. It was probably a little bit to the left of the Urban League and the NAACP and a little bit to the right of SNYCK and SCLC: Southern Christian Leadership Conference. That was Martin Luther King's organization. And to some extent there was overlap and to some extent the different organizations operated in different areas. For major events like the Selma march there was cooperation between the organizations. Although SCLC was the primary sponsor. So it was quite a busy time from the standpoint of civil rights. You know I was backing up our general council in moving forward civil rights litigation in Louisiana, in Florida and elsewhere in the South as well. I did that for three years and then moved to New Jersey to become executive director of the New Jersey affiliate of the American Civil Liberties Union. We did over 500 cases in one year while I was there. We did more cases than any other ACLU affiliate and in fact more cases than the two largest ACLU affiliates, New York and Southern California, combined. 

**SN:** One case that we did that I will never forget involved the rights of a bunch of people to march on the boardwalk in Atlantic City. They were banned from marching on the grounds that they were Nazis and as was the case in every situation like that we won that case and shortly after we won that case I got a call from a client in which he said "You know you people aren't so bad after all. We've decided that when we take power we will give you your choice of flavors of gas." I'm sure he thought that was very funny. I did not.

**BN:** You people being Jewish people or the ACLU?

**SN:** The ACLU, civil libertarians, liberals, Jewish people. I don't know whether he made the connection and I didn't ask him what he meant by that. I was rather shocked by the comment.

**BN:** Did that give you any pause in terms of representing people like that when it came to civil liberties or --

**SN:** No, if you don't defend civil liberties for the people who are least favored in our society, civil liberties are not safe for anyone. When cases arise, most frequently the group whose rights are infringed are people that are unpopular within a society. Although increasingly among people with a message that may be unpopular with law enforcement authorities that is mainstream within society as a whole.

**BN:** Right, so you see some kind of connection between that work and protest movements of today such as Black Lives Matter.

**SN:** Yes, I think the connection is a very clear one. I think efforts recently to pass new statutes blocking or limiting the ability to demonstrate or protest are a serious threat to civil liberties within this country which must be fought tooth and nail.

**BN:** What other cases for the ACLU are interesting or that you think were some of your best?

**SN:** There are a number of cases we did involving police brutality. It was a practice among the state police to stop and search unusual vehicles: VW vans. In search of drugs especially the drivers of men with long hair or if the van was painted with some kind of psychedelic colors. The war on drugs is roundly regarded as a failure today and the local manifestations in New Jersey and other states: searches, stop and frisk, and so on, was bad law enforcement from the standpoint of issues of illegal search and seizure.

**SN:** We were responsible for starting the Frontiero case. The case involved a woman in the military who was denied health benefits for her husband when men in the military were always granted family benefits including their wives and children. This was clearly a constitutional violation of the right of women to equal protections of the laws. A volunteer lawyer who I recruited to handle that case who won the case in the US Supreme Court was a lawyer named Ruth Bader Ginsberg. I was honored several years later when Justice Ginsberg came back to Rutgers Law School and thanked me and one other person active in the ACLU for getting her involved in public interest cases. We also at the time in the ACLU had an office in Newark to handle local problems: anything from welfare to the rights of individuals to secure housing and adequate assistance. We also had an office in the Camden area dealing with the rights of farmworkers which primarily focused on the right to organize which again is a first amendment right. And we formed the first chapter of the ACLU in the prison that was in Trenton. We also started the Prisoners' Rights Project and were unique in terms of ACLU affiliates in that regard. We were the only affiliates to do any of those things. By doing a large number of cases with a large amount of publicity we wanted to focus public attention on the issues. And from a standpoint of education I've always been a major advocate of doing everything you can apart from litigation to educate the public on what their rights are and so on.
