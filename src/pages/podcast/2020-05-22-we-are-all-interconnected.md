  Globally, we have reached nearly 5 million cases of COVID-19.  The leader in
  that number is the United States with over 1.5 million cases and almost 100000
  deaths or more. In this special episode of Mobilize, producer Betsy Nagler
  interviews three medical care providers on the frontlines of the pandemic
  about what they and their communities are going through, and what they think
  it means for the country.
