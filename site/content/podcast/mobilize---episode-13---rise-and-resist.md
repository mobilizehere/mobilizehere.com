Cory sat down with Wrolf Courtney, a local computer network engineer, to talk about his work with Rise and Resist, a NYC based resistance group, on “Operation Welcome Wagon” — a protest held in response to Trump’s first visit to NYC after his inauguration. This protest sent a message to Trump and the world that Trump is not welcome in his own hometown.
