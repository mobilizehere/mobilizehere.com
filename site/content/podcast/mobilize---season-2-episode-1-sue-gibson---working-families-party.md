Cory Choy spoke with rockstar , activist and volunteer Sue Gibson. After the shock of the 2017 election, Sue joined the working families party’s - progressive heroes project. She helped turn out voters to elect three progressive heroes who have gone on to either win their races, or place first in the primary. That includes Latoya Cantrell, The first woman ever to serve as New Orleans mayor. Vernetta Alston, a progressive and queer woman of color who won her primary for city council in Durham, North Carolina; And Randall Woodfin,  youngest ever elected mayor of Birmingham Alabama.
