Mobilize producer Cory Choy speaks with lifetime activist and volunteer Sue Gibson. After the shock of the 2016 election, Sue joined the Working Families Party’s Progressive Heroes project. She helped lead Text4Resistance teams in their efforts to turn out voters to elect numerous progressive candidates— many of whom have gone on to either win the primary or general election. These candidates include Latoya Cantrell, the first woman elected to serve as New Orleans’ mayor, Vernetta Alston, a progressive and queer woman of color who won her primary for city council in Durham, North Carolina, and Randall Woodfin, youngest ever elected mayor of Birmingham Alabama (among others).
