  Mobilize Producer Betsy Nagler speaks with Kristin Mink.


  Bringing with her her little baby Nova show in 2017 to tell the story of how
  she'd fought back against a hate crime directed toward immigrants in her
  community.

  Since then, she's become known as the woman who confronted former EPA chief
  Scott Pruitt in a restaurant and asked him to resign. In a video that went
  viral and may well have contributed to a subsequent ouster and as a co-founder
  of Lights for Liberty, an organization created to fight the Trump
  administration's immigrant detention camps.


  She returned to our studio, bringing with her her little baby Nova to talk
  about her work as an activist. How her eventual split with Lights for Liberty
  exemplifies some of the challenges facing progressives in 2020. And her advice
  for people looking to combine political involvement in an election year with
  parenthood.
