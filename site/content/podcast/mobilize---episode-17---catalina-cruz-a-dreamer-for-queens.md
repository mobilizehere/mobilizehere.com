Mobilize producer Betsy Nagler interviews Catalina Cruz about her New York State Assembly campaign for District 39, a district she’s proud to call “rich in that immigrant soul.” Cruz shares the inspiring story of how she went from being an undocumented Dreamer to a leader who fights for change in her community, and how she wants to be model of what it means to a public servant rather than a politician in the Trump era.
