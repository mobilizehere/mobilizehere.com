  It's been 16 months since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic that shut down
  businesses and schools worldwide, forcing many to undertake drastic measures
  and switch to virtual and remote learning for the 2020 school year. But with
  the production of the COVID-19 vaccine completed, the 2021 school year coming
  into view, and with new regulations put out by the CDC, many wonder what
  schools will do for the coming year. Mobilize intern Tom Lezon sat down with
  four teachers from New York and New Jersey to see what they and their
  establishments are planning to do to prepare for the upcoming school year and
  what it'll mean for the country going forward.
